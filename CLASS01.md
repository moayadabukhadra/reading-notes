## Pain vs. Suffering

- its gonna be a journey with a lot of pain , and a lot of success 

*thats why we dont say suffering beacuse suffering means there is no success comes with the pain*

## Big O Notation

"it's used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario,"

![Big O notation equation](https://github.com/moayadabukhadra/reading-notes/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(89).png)

### the first function O(1):

*the relation between the elements and the time for it is static it dosent matter how many elements or inputs the function have it will take the same time to run this function*

### the sec function O(n):

*the relation between the elements and the time for it is linear so if the 1 inputs takes 10 of space to run the function  10 inputs will take 100 of space to run the function*

### the 3rd fun O(n^2)

*it needs a lot of time and space to run it so we are always trying to avoide it*

##  Facts and Myths about Python names and values

- the names refers to values:
*for example name = 7 we refer the value 7 to the variable name*

- names are reassigned independently:

*if we refered y to the value name=7 ==> y=name and then changed the value of name==> name = 20 , y will still be 7 which is the old value of name or the first value that refered to y because "names are reassigned independently"*

### *what if we refered a name to a list for example x = [1,2,3] and we refered y to x ==> y= x so the value of y will be [1,2,3] if we*

*if we changed the value of x or the list by using any of the lisits fun as append and add a value 4 to the list [1,2,3,4] the value of y will change also because y is the list so for the lists the changes are reassigned its called "mutable values"*
