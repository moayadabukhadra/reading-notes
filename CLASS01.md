## Pain vs. Suffering

- its gonna be a journey with a lot of pain , and a lot of success 

*thats why we dont say suffering beacuse suffering means there is no success comes with the pain*

## Big O Notation

"it's used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario,"

![Big O notation equation](https://github.com/moayadabukhadra/reading-notes/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(89).png)

### the first function O(1):

*the relation between the elements and the time for it is static it dosent matter how many elements or inputs the function have it will take the same time to run this function*

### the sec function O(n):

*the relation between the elements and the time for it is linear so if the 1 inputs takes 10 of space to run the function  10 inputs will take 100 of space to run the function*

### the 3rd fun O(n^2)

*it needs a lot of time and space to run it so we are always trying to avoide it*
