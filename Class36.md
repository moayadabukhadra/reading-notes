## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

- Whiteboard-style interviews are ubiquitous in the tech industry. For those who not had the pleasure, whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.

### Communicate

- The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

- Restate the Question

Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

- Again, you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well). 



## Tips

1.  Take a few minutes.

- Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

2. Write down the steps of the solution.

- Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard,

3. Don’t sweat the small stuff.

- Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.


4.  Sit down. Be humble.
A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. For example:


- Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?

- Do you treat the interviewer with respect?

- How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?

- Are you able to collaborate with others to come 
up with solutions?

- Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?

- Are you honest (especially about yourself)?
