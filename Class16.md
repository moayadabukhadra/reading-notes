# Serverless

- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that 

1. Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event

2. Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running. 

## [what is serverless](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/html5/html5lib/v2.76/mwEmbedFrame.php/p/1773841/uiconf_id/39954662/entry_id/1_n7r8gf71?wid=_1773841&iframeembed=true&playerId=kplayer&entry_id=1_n7r8gf71&flashvars[streamerType]=auto#)


## Serverless pros and cons

### pros

-  serverless enables development teams to focus on writing code, not managing infrastructure. 

- serverless customers pay for execution only. The meter starts when the request is made, and ends when execution finishes. 

- Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework - Java, Python, node.js - with which they're comfortable.

### Cons 

- Stable or predictable workloads

- Cold starts

- Monitoring and debugging

- Vendor lock-in

## Understanding the serverless stack

- Defining serverless as a set of common attributes, instead of as an explicit technology, makes it easier to understand how the serverless approach can manifest in other core areas of the stack.

- Functions as a Service (FaaS)

- Serverless databases and storage: Databases (SQL and NoSQL) and storage (particularly object storage) are the foundation of the data layer.


## Comparing FaaS to PaaS, containers, and VMs

## Serverless Functions
 
- You can use Serverless Functions to handle user authentication, form submission, database queries, custom slack commands, and more.
