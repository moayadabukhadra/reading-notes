# Getting started with Django

### Why Django?

- With Django, you can take web applications from concept to launch in a matter of hours.

- Fully loaded

Django includes dozens of extras you can use to handle common web development tasks.

- Reassuringly secure

Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery and clickjacking.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

- Django is a Python-based web framework

-  It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developerâ€™s computer and used alongside the official documentation.

-Django Software Foundation

The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

## Is Django opinionated?

- Web frameworks often refer to themselves as "opinionated" or "unopinionated".

Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task. They often support rapid development in a particular domain (solving problems of a particular type) because the right way to do anything is usually well-understood and well-documented. However they can be less flexible at solving problems outside their main domain, and tend to offer fewer choices for what components and approaches they can use.

## What does Django code look like?

-In a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP requests from the web browser (or other client). When a request is received the application works out what is needed based on the URL and possibly information in POST data or GET data.
